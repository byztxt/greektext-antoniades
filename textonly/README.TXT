Note:

The files with extension .ANT represent the text of the Antoniades
1904/1912 Patriarchal Edition, as verified and corrected by Maurice A.
Robinson and Jussi Ala-Konni. The text herein presented has been
thoroughly compared to the 1904 edition and double-checked against the
1912 edition (which serves as the primary base text, differences from
the 1904 edition specifically noted in the collation).

The file BYZ-ANT.TXT provides a complete collation of differences
between the Robinson-Pierpont Byzantine Textform 2005 edition and the
Antoniades Patriarchal Edition in both its original 1904 and corrected
1912 forms.

The resultant Antoniades 1912 base text and collation is presumed to be
completely accurate. Any minor oversights in this regard should be
reported to the collators for immediate correction as necessary.

The files herein presented are thus far more accurate than any of the
various Antoniades or Patriarchal edition files currently available on
the internet and represent a true precise agreement with Antoniades'
original work as published.

For the current electronic form of the Antoniades text all instances of
movable Nu and Sigma have been regularized (movable Nu's are always
present; movable Sigma is always present on OUTWS but never on ACRI or
MECRI).

The verse division of the text has been adjusted to agree with that
found in the Online Bible software program.
